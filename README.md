# Color-Hole3D
Prototype for Color Hole3D

Before opening the project, please read here.

Added 3 different scenes, all corresponds to different mechanics.

- First scene has a model which has a hole inside, and you will be moving it with the vertices.
- Second scene is shader based movement, which is the tricky one.
- Last scene is mesh deformation, ground calculates the distance between the hole cyclinder, and deactivates the corresponding triangles. 
Need to note that. I don't have a knowlodge about triangulation, so can't add additional triangles to make it fit just like a circle.
